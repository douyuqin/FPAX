# FPAX
FPAX is a framework for exploring approximate configurations, which utilizes prior knowledge to guide DSE, thus avoiding a large amount of redundant calculations and achieving high-quality approximate configurations in a short amount of time.
Before using FPAX, we need to guide the following requirements：
（1）DSE.py is the main.py. We can run DSE.py to get the results.
 (2) model.pt is a trained NN model.
 (3)
